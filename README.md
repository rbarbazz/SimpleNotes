# Simple Notes

Simple Notes is a World of Warcraft addon that allows you to take and save notes for your character. This addon was developed for WoW Classic but should work fine for other versions of the game.

## Features

- Create and save notes for your character.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.
- Notes are saved per character.

## Usage

You can use the following slash commands to interact with the addon:

`/snsave` - Save the current notes.  
`/snprint` - Print the current notes to the chat.  
`/sn` - Toggle the notes frame.

***Note**: Currently, there is no dedicated button to open the notes. To make it easier to open the notes, you can bind the `/sn` command to a macro.*
